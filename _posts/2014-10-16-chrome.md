Chrome users don't have an option in the GUI to disable SSLv3 as Google removed it due to confusion over whether SSLv3 or TLSv1 was better with one having a higher numeric value. Instead you can add the command line flag `--ssl-version-min=tls1` to enforce the use of TLS and prevent any connection using the SSL protocol. In Windows, right click on your Chrome shortcut, hit Properties and add the command line flag as seen in the image below.

If you use Google Chrome on Mac, Linux, Chrome OS or Android, you can follow these instructions [here](http://www.chromium.org/for-testers/command-line-flags).
