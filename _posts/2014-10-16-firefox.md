Firefox users can type `about:config` into their address bar and then `security.tls.version.min` into the search box. This will bring up the setting that needs to be changed from `0` to `1`. The existing setting allows Firefox to use SSLv3 where it's available and if it's required. By changing the setting you will force Firefox to only ever use TLSv1.0 or better, which is not vulnerable to POODLE.
