To disable SSLv3 on your Apache server you can configure it using the following.

`SSLProtocol All -SSLv2 -SSLv3`

This will give you support for TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2, but explicitly removes support for SSLv2 and SSLv3. Check the config and then restart Apache. 

`apachectl configtest`

`sudo service apache2 restart`
