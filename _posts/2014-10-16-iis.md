This one requires some registry tweaks and a server reboot but still isn't all that bad. Microsoft have a [support article](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/187498/en-us) with the required information, but all you need to do is modify/create a registry DWORD value. 

`HKey_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders \SCHANNEL\Protocols`

Inside protocols you will most likely have an `SSL 2.0` key already, so create `SSL 3.0` alongside it if needed. Under that create a `Server` key and inside there a DWORD value called `Enabled` with value `0`. Once that's done reboot the server for the changes to take effect.
