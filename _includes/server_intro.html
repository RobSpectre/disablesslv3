<h2>How To Protect Your Server</h2>
The easiest and most robust solution to POODLE is to disable SSLv3 support on your server. This does bring with it a couple of caveats though. For web traffic, there are some legacy systems out there that won't be able to connect with anything other than SSLv3. For example, systems using IE6 and Windows XP installations without SP3, will no longer be able to communicate with any site that ditches SSLv3. According to figures released by <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/sslv3-support-disabled-by-default-due-to-vulnerability/">CloudFlare</a>, who have completely disabled SSLv3 across their entire customer estate, only a tiny fraction of their web traffic will be affected as 98.88% of Windows XP users connect with TLSv1.0 or better.
