##Exploiting POODLE
There are many, great explanations of exactly what POODLE is and how it can be exploited already out on the web, so I won't try to replicate the details here. There are great write ups from [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/~bodo/ssl-poodle.pdf) and [Adam Langley](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html). The whole issue, however, ultimately hinges on the site supporting SSLv3 and the attacker being able to downgrade the client to use SSLv3. These protocol downgrade attacks are old news and are still surfacing to cause problems. By simulating a failure during the negotiation process, an attacker can force a browser and a server to renegotiate using an older protocol, right back down to SSLv3. As the POODLE vulnerability is actually in the protocol itself, this isn't something that can be patched out like ShellShock and HeartBleed.
