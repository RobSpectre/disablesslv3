<h2>Is there another way?</h2>
<p>Google mentioned on their <a
href="http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/this-poodle-bites-exploiting-ssl-30.html">Online
Security Blog</a> that they have been using <a
href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-downgrade-scsv-00">TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV</a>
with Chrome and their own servers and mitigated possible protocol downgrade
attacks. By introducing a new cipher suite value, `TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV {0x56,
0x00}`, the browser can indicate to the server that the current connection
attempt is a fallback from a previously failed connection attempt and is not
using the best protocol it can support. The new cipher suite value is included
alongside the existing cipher suite values in the ClientHello message, but as a
Signalling Cipher Suite Value (SCSV) it cannot be selected or used by the server
as it does not correspond to an actual suite. When the server receives this
value, it knows the connection attempt is a fallback and can act upon that
information. If the server supports a protocol version higher than the one
indicated in the ClientHello when TLS\_FALLBACK\_SCSV is present, the server
must respond with an inappropriate\_fallback alert and not proceed with the
handshake. The server knows that this connection attempt is not the best
protocol the client can support.</p>

<p>Whilst TLS\_FALLBACK\_SCSV mitigates protocol downgrade attacks, support is
not yet widespread, with OpenSSL having only just <a
href="https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20141015.txt">announce support in
version 1.0.1j</a> and Google Chrome being the only browser to currently offer
support. Mozilla will disable SSLv3 by default in <a
href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2014/10/14/the-poodle-attack-and-the-end-of-ssl-3-0/">Firefox
34</a> which is to be released on Nov 25th and follow up with SCSV support in
Firefox 35. All other browsers and web server platforms would need to implement
support for this new feature which would then need to be updated to all clients
and servers in the wild. Even then, it doesn't actually resolve the POODLE
vulnerability, it just means that clients and servers can continue to support
SSLv3 where absolutely needed without exposing everyone to the same risk.
Ideally, SSLv3 should be consigned to the scrap heap and clients/servers should
move on to newer and better protocols like TLS. After all, it is almost 18 years
old and was superceeded by TLS 15 years ago.</p>
