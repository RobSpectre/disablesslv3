## Disable SSLv3

A community-powered step-by-step tutorial on disabling SSLv3.

As the Internet sets to the work of mitigating the [POODLE
vulnerability](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3566),
this project is a Jekyll site expanding on [Scott
Helme's](https://scotthelme.co.uk/) excellent step-by-step tutorial into a
community project where developers and security professionals can aggregate all
the procedures for disabling SSLv3 on all the platforms, servers and clients
that are available.

Scott's work is a great start - fork and contribute your mitigation procedures
to build a one-stop tutorial for anyone looking to mitigate POODLE.
